Initial synth results

TransformDivide:
Gates: 35,103
Area: 44,518.56 um^2
Critical-path delay: 6,134.93 ps

XiaoLinWu:
Gates: 12,540
Area: 14,886.96 um^2
Critical-path delay: 4,380.15 ps


Build for FPGA:

Lots of timing violations

Worst: transformAndDivide involving inFIFO and midFIFO
	Requirement: 20 ns
	Data Path Delay: 45.893 ns
	

Connectal Main Clock:
Worst net slack (ns) : -26.168
Total net slack (ns) : -5928.585

Why is the Total net slack so large? Are there others? Or does the one have some multiplicative effect?

Initially 11 DSP_48 blocks used
Removed all mults except one from transformAndDivide, went to 3, so there are two others somewhere.
Well, there are two multiplications in the mapToIntegers function, so it's probably them.
